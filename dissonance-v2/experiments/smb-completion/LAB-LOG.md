# SMB completion lab log

## 2026-08-10 — setup

- The original checkout was rejected for experiment use because its HEAD was `6bf71bb64408bb1ed18b4e2670a0fb9bf0139111`, not the pinned base.
- Created dedicated worktree `/Users/phemberger/workspace/harmony-smb-completion` and branch `codex/smb-completion` directly from `8f2b522c26c6f192f2db45a430bec03ed447cad7`.
- Verified the worktree was clean and recorded `BASE_COMMIT=8f2b522c26c6f192f2db45a430bec03ed447cad7`.
- Read `AGENTS.md`, `dissonance-v2/CLAUDE.md`, all three governing Dissonance documents, and `dissonance-v2/NOTES.md` as present at the base commit.
- Preregistered the frozen-baseline reproduction, seed split, acceptance rule, and H1 before running a campaign.

## Baseline reproduction

- External ROM SHA-256 matched the required `0b3d9e1f01ed1668205bab34d6c82b0e281456e137352e4f36a9b2cfa3b66dea`.
- The frozen six-seed M5 runner completed at 500 executions per seed. Because the checked-in base includes M10's 16-pixel metric, the raw ratchet maxima were `[37, 45, 20, 29, 36, 37]` and the random-walk maxima were `[12, 10, 10, 19, 19, 11]`; the ratchet upper median was 37 versus 12. The preregistered historical M5 values use the pre-M10 64-pixel observer and cannot be emitted by the checked-in M12 code. This is a metric-granularity deviation, not a search rerun failure.
- The best autonomous source corpus was seed `0x5eed_d701`: 25 retained inputs and max-x 45.
- Reconstructed the frozen M12 restart control from that corpus at seed `0x5eed_dc00` for 500 executions. It retained 50 inputs and reproduced the recorded M12 frontier max-x 62 without a detector, generated mutator, model process, supplied input, or intermediate state.
- A second complete campaign was structurally identical to the first. Replaying the starting champion twice produced an identical complete observation trace.
- Starting champion input SHA-256: `f5ea861ef624b4033684a13e077e6faa66ebfdef0681d276153424bb63413aee`.
- Starting champion observation-trace SHA-256: `d00f3b0760b1cf58fdb86827b25faa59e50b2010695195da2583ff11080e3095`.
- Raw evidence: `dissonance-v2/target/smb-completion/baseline-m5/`, `dissonance-v2/target/smb-completion/baseline-champion-film/`, and `dissonance-v2/target/smb-completion/m12-reproduction/`.

## Hypothesis ledger

| ID | Status | Falsifiable claim | Smallest test | Development result | Held-out result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | accepted | Global novelty discards reusable local frontier states, causing repeated long-prefix reconstruction. | Bounded deterministic snapshot-backed quality-diversity archive plus short seeded suffix search. | Controls `[104, 88, 108, 103, 105, 105]`; challengers `[146, 147, 173, 86, 152, 82]`; 4/6 paired wins; upper median 105→147. | Controls `[105, 115, 88, 97, 97, 104]`; challengers `[146, 154, 82, 147, 177, 140]`; 5/6 paired wins; upper median 104→147. |

## H1 — accepted snapshot archive

- Instrumentation smoke: seed `0x5eed_e000`, 100 executions, 342 retained entries, four death transitions, and an exact full-report replay.
- Development challenger checkpoint-curve areas (100-execution samples): `[6116, 6047, 6350, 3961, 5505, 4080]`.
- Development final-maximum arrival executions: `[3300, 4100, 5000, 2100, 4900, 300]`. Low seeds and flat curves were retained without filtering or extra budget.
- Held-out champion: seed `0x5eed_e104`, 5,000 executions, max-x 177, 5,930 lineage entries, 312 death transitions, input SHA-256 `92c879eea15988b8818f5a1d5b02a834a6761829506261ffe2acecfbf7af1b83`, observation SHA-256 `3c61407dab5eb6cff52bb5438617adf704a5e132c744eb5bf89d9450fc5f63f3`.
- The complete held-out champion campaign reproduced exactly in an independent no-model rerun (`replay_verified=true`).
- Its film ends on the final 1-1 staircase. Its curve rose from max-x 170 at execution 4,400 to 174 at 4,500 and 177 at 4,800, so scaling this accepted search is permitted before adding machinery.
- Raw evidence: `dissonance-v2/target/smb-completion/h1-dev/`, `dissonance-v2/target/smb-completion/h1-held/`, and `dissonance-v2/target/smb-completion/h1-promotion-replay-e104/`.

### Rejected cache calibration C1

Hypothesis: a larger frozen prefix cache plus per-action prefix snapshots would materially reduce control wall time without changing target-execution results. Two 5,000-execution e000 calibration runs were preserved under `target/smb-completion/cache-equivalence/`. Neither materially outpaced the completed frozen control because state-save overhead offset replay savings. Both were stopped, and the cache changes were removed. Do not repeat C1 without a different measured cache design.
