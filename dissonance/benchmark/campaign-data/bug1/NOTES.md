# Bug 1 (fault-timing) box campaign — data, recipe, and the resume state

## Status (2026-07-06): infra + logging validated live; calibration blocked on a
## seal/arm interaction. GO/NO-GO #2 still PENDING. This is the checkpointed
## resume point — everything below is on `origin/task/signal-bug-correlation`.

## What is proven live (real patched KVM)
- Socket console capture works; the **real** LogSensor/CellFnV1 produces cells
  (0 → 3) once the guest logs realistically (`campaign-super` now logs bug-agnostic
  operational lines: lifecycle phase / backpressure / checkpoint).
- The campaign image was rebuilt with the logged `campaign-super`
  (`initramfs-campaign.cpio.gz`, 2026-07-06 15:04).
- Box hygiene: worktree `~/harmony-t69m2`; `source ~/.cargo/env`; `taskset -c $CORE`;
  `/root/box-window.sh acquire/release`. **Runs MUST be foreground with the release
  inline** — a background/timed-out ssh orphans the guest and holds patched KVM (seen
  twice); recover by `kill -9 <pid>` (exact PIDs, not the CI runner) then
  `rmmod kvm_intel kvm; modprobe kvm; modprobe kvm_intel` and verify `1396736` on a
  fresh ssh.

## ⛔ SUPERSEDED (2026-07-07) — the "verb not supported" blocker was STALE; the real
## blocker is crash-terminal FEASIBILITY. See "## 2026-07-07 GROUND TRUTH" below.
## Everything in this section is kept for history but is NOT the current blocker.

## THE BLOCKER (calibration) — a fault offset > 0 is rejected "verb not supported"
- `calibration.json` sets bug 1's gpa to the real ledger **canary** gpa on the
  logged image (`0x7fbe2000` = 2143166464; printed as `CAMPAIGN_LEDGER_GPA` at boot,
  deterministic).
- A fault with window `[1500,1520]` (offset ~500 past the seal) fails at **branch 0**
  (before any fire) with `control error: verb not supported by this backend`
  (= `ControlError::Unsupported`, `vmm-core/src/control.rs` `check_fault_admissible`).
- A fault with window `[1003,1004]` (offset ~0, `at ≈ floor`) does **not** fail — the
  run progresses. So the **real gpa is fine; the fault OFFSET is the issue** (my
  earlier "gpa-specific" guess was wrong).
- Diagnosis: `at == floor` applies immediately (no arming); `at > floor` needs the
  exact-count arrival seam (`Vmm::arm_arrival` / `can_arm_arrival()`), which returns
  Unsupported here even though task-59 implemented arm_arrival and its box gate passed.
  Likely cause: **`seal_base`'s snapshot-retry lands the base at a point that is
  quiescent-for-snapshot but NOT arm-capable (synchronized)**, unlike task-60's seal.
  Confirm by comparing `can_arm_arrival()` at the bench seal vs the task-60 seal.
### FOREMAN RULINGS (2026-07-06) + the confirmed fix design
- **Ruling: option (a)** — make `seal_base` land at an arm-capable synchronized
  boundary (keep a REAL window search). Option (b) (offset-0) is REJECTED as primary:
  it thins exactly the timing-window search this benchmark discriminates on.
- **First CONFIRM the diagnosis**: compare `can_arm_arrival()` at the bench seal vs
  the task-60 seal. Practical confirm without server instrumentation: run task-60's
  `conductor campaign box` (its own `--gpa-base`/`--window-*`) against the **new logged
  image** with an offset>0 fault. If it ALSO fails "verb not supported", the arm-
  incapable seal is a property of the image/seal, not bench-specific (the realistic
  logging moved the seal point off a synchronized boundary); if task-60 works, the
  bench harness differs and that difference is the bug.
- **Scope**: fix INSIDE this task's surface if the bench harness can do it against
  EXISTING vmm-core APIs (a seal-retry *condition*). Only if it needs a vmm-core/control
  change: keep it minimal, call it out in the PR as a task-59 seam amendment, do NOT
  split into a separate task (M2 blocks 70/72/76). If that change is non-trivial
  (semantics, not a retry condition) → checkpoint + escalate, don't build it.

### Refined root cause + the in-surface fix (retry-condition, existing APIs)
The snapshot-retry in `seal_base` retries only on `NotQuiescent`, so it lands at the
first **snapshottable** point — which is NOT necessarily **synchronized / arm-capable**
(a deadline/quiescent stop can be off a V-time intercept). A fault at offset>0 then
can't arm. Fix `seal_base` to also require arm-capability before committing the base:
after `snapshot()` succeeds, **probe** it — `machine.branch(base, <minimal CorruptMemory
at relative offset 1>)`; the branch-time fault validation is side-effect-free on
rejection (`control.rs` doc), so `Ok` ⇒ arm-capable (the staged probe fault is
discarded by the campaign's first real branch), a `verb-not-supported` reject ⇒ NOT
arm-capable → `drop_snap` + nudge (`run(deadline vt+step)`) + re-snapshot, looping to
`snapshot_max_attempts`. Detection caveat: `ControlError::Unsupported` currently maps to
`MachineError::Transport("control error: verb not supported by this backend")` — either
string-match that message, or (cleaner) add a distinct `MachineError::Unsupported`
variant in `explorer::adapter::control_error_to_machine` and match it. **This is
untested — implement + validate on the box (rebuild, one calibration run fires +
certifies 25/25 at a small deadline_delta) before the ≥20-seed runs.**

### Fairness ruling (bug 2 answer): the 3-cell vocabulary IS a fair test
The guardrail was against silently faking the keyer, not against small vocabularies.
The real sensor making 3 cells from bug-agnostic operational logging is the honest
condition. **Do NOT enrich the logging to help the signal.** Record the cell count
prominently in `CORRELATION-REPORT.md` alongside the zero-cell scope statement, and
rule GO/NO-GO on the data — an honest NO-GO is a real result.

## Wall-time finding (feasibility) — use a SMALL deadline_delta
- With `--deadline-delta 2000000`, a non-triggering branch runs the full 2M V-time:
  ~8 branches took **>400 s** (≈35–50 s/branch incl. ~120 s boot). A ≥20-seed ×
  2-config × ~512-branch campaign at this rate is many hours.
- Drop `--deadline-delta` to ~**50k–200k** V-time (enough for the fault to land + the
  guard to fire, so a non-triggering branch stops quickly). Re-verify a find still
  fires + certifies 25/25 at the smaller bound.

## Remaining recipe (resumable — foreman or fresh session)
1. **Unblock calibration** (above): bug 1 fires + certifies 25/25 at a small
   deadline_delta, real gpa, arm-capable seal (or offset-0 fault).
2. **Bug 1 campaign**: `conductor bench-campaign --bug 1 --config signal|baseline
   --seed S --max-branches ~512 --deadline-delta <small> --calibration calibration.json
   --initramfs initramfs-campaign.cpio.gz --ready-marker CAMPAIGN_READY --out
   campaign-data/bug1/1-<config>-<S>.json`, ≥20 distinct seeds × both configs,
   3-wide (foreground, release inline). Collect JSONs + `FIND … state_hash` lines.
   **Determinism spot-check**: re-run ~3 seeds `--exclusive` (solo) and diff the JSON
   + state_hash vs the co-tenant run — a mismatch is a P0 leak → STOP + escalate.
   Commit + push (checkpoint 1).
3. **order/uuid**: add the same realistic bug-agnostic logging to `order-super.c` /
   `uuid-super.c`; write `build-order-image.sh`/`build-uuid-image.sh` +
   `order-init.sh`/`uuid-init.sh` (model on `build-campaign-image.sh`/`campaign-init.sh`,
   markers `ORDER_READY`/`UUID_READY`); build; calibrate each trigger; run + commit+push
   per `(bug × config)`.
4. **Report**: concat all `CampaignLog`s → `benchmark-report --logs all.json --out
   dissonance/benchmark/CORRELATION-REPORT.md`. **Record the zero-cell scope statement**
   (the log-template signal is inert on silent workloads; selectors must fall back to
   baseline on zero cells). Rule GO/NO-GO honestly — an honest NO-GO is a real result.

## 2026-07-07 GROUND TRUTH (fresh session; box-verified) — supersedes the seal-arm story

**The "verb not supported" blocker was STALE and mis-diagnosed.** Two facts, one from
static analysis (code at HEAD 136db19; no Rust changed since 040771d) and one from a
live box run, kill it:

1. **Static:** `can_arm_arrival()` is `vtime.is_some() && backend.deterministic_tsc` —
   a **static backend capability**, NOT a property of the seal point. Patched KVM sets
   `deterministic_tsc = true` (`vmm-backend/src/kvm.rs:728`), and V-time is always wired,
   so `can_arm_arrival()` is **unconditionally true** on the bench server. A plain minted
   `Recorded{Host(CorruptMemory)}` env (which is what bug 1's branch envs are — identical
   structure for offset-0 and offset-500, only the `Moment` key differs) passes **every**
   `Unsupported` gate in `control.rs`'s `restore`/`check_fault_admissible`. So the code
   **cannot** return `Unsupported` for bug 1's fault in an offset-dependent way. The
   "re-seal to an arm-capable boundary" fix targets a mechanism that does not exist.
2. **Live:** `bench-campaign --bug 1 --config baseline --seed 1 --deadline-delta 200000
   --calibration calibration.json` (window `[1500,1520]` → offset ~496 past the seal)
   runs **cleanly**: EXIT=0, all branches log, real LogSensor makes cells, KVM reverts to
   stock. **No "verb not supported".** The offset>0 fault stages and applies fine.

**THE REAL BLOCKER — crash-terminal feasibility (this is what actually gates M2):**
Per-branch `BENCH_DIAG=1` shows the bug DOES fire. Branches with the correct canary gpa
`0x7fbe2000` print the `CAMPAIGN_BUG` marker (`marker=true`) — the planted bug triggers.
But the crash terminal is the SLOW path: all three isa-debug-exit channels FAIL on this
kernel (no `CONFIG_X86_IOPL_IOPERM` / `CONFIG_DEVPORT` — documented in
`conductor/IMPLEMENTATION.md`), so the bug falls back to `_exit(0x60)` → `/init` `reboot -f`
→ triple-fault → `Crash{Shutdown}`. That reboot is at **seal + ~4.8M V-time**:
  - deadline 200000 → firing branch stops at **`Deadline`** (`judge=false`) BEFORE the
    crash → **NOT certified** (this is why the small-deadline plan / ruling (c) fails).
  - deadline 8_000_000 → firing branch reaches **`Crash{Shutdown}`** at vtime 463116585,
    `judge=true`, **CERTIFIES 25/25** (seed 1, branch 1, state_hash
    `bc3cde425cd3e74ff0310c7eb353d595b703a5a2a7dd7799366995e3480ecf9d`). **Gate 2
    (benchmark validity) for bug 1 is DONE** — the reproducer replays the identical crash.

**Box cost model (measured):** ~60k vns/sec; per-branch ≈ `1.7s + deadline/60_000`.
Non-firing branch runs the busy loop to the deadline; firing branch executes ~4.8M vns to
the reboot. So crash-terminal certification needs deadline ≥ ~5M → **~80–133 s/branch** →
a 120-campaign suite (≥20 seeds × 2 configs × 3 bugs) is **infeasible** (weeks).

**THE FIX (decision point — see issue #66 / commit): terminal-agnostic, marker-based
certification.** A find = the per-bug MARKER present + 25/25 replays reproducing the
identical `(stop, state_hash)` — decoupled from *which* terminal. Run the ≥20-seed
CORRELATION campaigns at a SMALL deadline (~2s/branch, feasible: ~6h for 120 campaigns
3-wide); the marker (at seal+~500) is captured well before the small deadline, and 25/25
determinism still holds at the `Deadline` stop. Gate-2 VALIDITY (a real `Crash`) is proven
separately per bug with ONE large-deadline run (bug 1 already ✅ above). Gate integrity is
preserved: the marker is per-bug and only the planted bug prints it (attribution), and
25/25 identity is unchanged (determinism). The M1 gate-integrity tests still hold
(unmarked crash → no marker → not a find; drifting hash → replays differ → not certified).

## 2026-07-07 FOREMAN RULING + VALIDATED + CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED (recycle handoff)

**Foreman ruling (on the flagged marker-based-cert decision):** PROVISIONALLY
APPROVED, 4 binding conditions: (1) per-find cert = marker + 25/25 identical
`(stop, state_hash, marker)` at the campaign deadline [✅ implemented exactly];
(2) per-bug VALIDITY cert MANDATORY — one large-deadline run proving the marker's
branch reaches a real `Crash`, for EACH bug before it enters the suite [bug 1 ✅
`Crash{Shutdown}`@463116585 / state_hash bc3cde42..., certified 25/25; bugs 2/3
PENDING]; (3) CORRELATION-REPORT.md must state the two-part realization
explicitly; (4) keep the gate-integrity tests [✅ kept + added
`marker_bearing_deadline_stop_is_a_find`].

**IMPLEMENTED (commit baa1fed):** terminal-agnostic marker-based certification in
`benchcampaign.rs` — find = `marker_attributed(&trace, spec)`; `certify_replays`
is marker- + deadline-aware (replays run at the campaign `until`, require
identical `(stop, state_hash)` + marker each), `verify_replays` removed. All 11
benchcampaign tests green.

**VALIDATED on box:** bug 1 certifies a find at deadline **50000** via the
marker path (seed 1 branch 1 → `Deadline`@458446116, marker=true, certified 25/25,
state_hash ffadc25d...). Box reverts to stock cleanly.

**CAMPAIGN PARAMETERS (chosen):** `--deadline-delta 50000 --max-branches 512
--replay-n 25`, 20 seeds (1..20) × 2 configs, 3-wide + 3 solo (baseline seeds
1..3) `--exclusive` determinism spot-checks. Bug 1 is EASY on the box (fires on
ANY canary bit-flip at gpa 0x7fbe2000 — the guest checks the canary every loop
iteration, so no timing-window constraint like the toy; P(fire)≈1/4 → found at
~4 branches). The hard, discriminating bugs are 2 (interrupt 1/256) and 3
(rare-entropy 1/256) — they need the 512 budget.

**ORCHESTRATOR:** `dissonance/benchmark/campaign-data/run-bug1-campaign.sh`
(committed). **Box-window concurrency lesson (2 failed launches):** NEVER
background `box-window.sh acquire` — concurrent first-acquires race the
window-open (`load_patched` ABORTs once patched is loaded → empty core). The
robust design: acquire 3 PERSISTENT leases SERIALLY up front, run 3 fixed-core
serial streams, release all 3 at the end, then solo `--exclusive` spot-checks.
Launched detached; results land in `~/t69m2-results/bug1/` on the box
(`progress.log`, `*.json`, `finds.log`, `determinism.log`).

**BOX COST MODEL (measured):** ~60k vns/sec; per-branch ≈ `3s overhead +
deadline/60k` (deadline 50000 → ~3.8s non-firing). Firing branches overshoot the
opportunistic deadline to ~seal+157k (the reboot's next exit) → ~5.6s; the
25-replay cert ≈ ~140s (once per campaign, at the first find). ~30-40 min/campaign
→ bug-1 suite (43 campaigns) ≈ ~8h at 3-wide.

**REMAINING RECIPE (for the fresh session):**
1. Monitor `~/t69m2-results/bug1/progress.log` until `ORCH DONE`; check
   `determinism.log` for `P0-DIVERGENCE` (a solo≠co-tenant hash is a P0 STOP +
   escalate — never serialize to hide it). `scp` the `*.json` back, commit under
   `dissonance/benchmark/campaign-data/bug1/`. Box hygiene: if the orchestrator
   dies, `kill -9 -<pgid>`, `pgrep -x conductor | xargs -r kill -9`, then
   `rmmod kvm_intel kvm; modprobe kvm; modprobe kvm_intel` and verify 1396736 on
   a FRESH ssh (never `pkill -f` — self-matches the wrapper argv).
2. **Bugs 2 (order) & 3 (uuid):** their guest sources exist
   (`guest/linux/order-super.c`, `uuid-super.c`) but need the same realistic
   bug-agnostic operational logging campaign-super got, plus
   `build-order-image.sh`/`build-uuid-image.sh` + `order-init.sh`/`uuid-init.sh`
   (model on `build-campaign-image.sh`/`campaign-init.sh`; markers
   `ORDER_READY`/`UUID_READY`; both `crash_kind: Shutdown` — same reboot fallback,
   the channels fail the same way). Build; calibrate each trigger on the box
   (order: vector 0x81 + window offset; uuid: 8-bit prefix — the entropy draw is
   post-snapshot RDRAND, so it varies per branch); **gate-2 validity run each**
   (large deadline, confirm a real `Crash` + 25/25 — condition 2) BEFORE the
   suite; then run 20×2 campaigns each (clone the orchestrator, swap
   `--bug`/`--initramfs`/`--ready-marker`/`--calibration`).
3. **Report:** concat all `*.json` → `benchmark-report --logs all.json --out
   dissonance/benchmark/CORRELATION-REPORT.md`. STATE THE TWO-PART REALIZATION
   (condition 3): correlation runs = marker-based finds at a small deadline;
   validity = per-bug large-deadline `Crash` + 25/25. Record the cell count +
   zero-cell scope statement. Rule GO/NO-GO honestly (GO needs cell novelty
   correlating with bug progress on ≥2 of 3 bugs + signal median not worse than
   baseline on any bug; else NO-GO → iterate task-67 CellFn). Note bug 1's
   easy/degenerate TTB (~4, low variance) — it will show weak correlation; the
   ruling leans on bugs 2/3.

**Other confirmed facts:**
- Ledger gpa `0x7fbe2000` (canary) is correct for the logged image (boot prints
  `CAMPAIGN_LEDGER_GPA: canary=0x7fbe2000`). calibration.json `crash_kind: Shutdown` is
  right (the reboot fallback IS a Shutdown).
- The three issue-#66 P2s (#3 stads `Frac` overflow, #4 order-super torn window, #5
  ORDER_BUG crash_kind Shutdown) are **already folded in** (all cite "round-7 P2").
- `BENCH_DIAG=1` env-gated per-branch diagnostics added to `run_bench_campaign` (stderr
  only, never touches state/hash — a golden run is bit-identical). Keep it; it's how you
  watch a long campaign + calibrate a bug.
