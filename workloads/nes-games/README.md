# NES game logic

`nes-games` holds the game logic of the NES workloads: Super Mario Bros., Mega
Man 2, Metroid, Castlevania, Super Tilt Bro, Twin Dragons, Famidash, Punch-Out!!, The Legend of
Zelda and Pac-Man. It builds for the
host and for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, so the browser demo can run the same
game logic as the native workload.

Each game module has a `target` with the RAM decoder, observations, snapshots,
setup tapes and the `Target` implementation, and an `archive` with the
controller vocabulary, archive keys and milestones. Mega Man 2, Metroid and
Castlevania also have a `progress` module for named progress. Famidash has a `levels`
module with each side's level names, lengths and groups. `chord` holds the
controller chord draw. `nes_backend` holds the `NesBackend`, `NesMemory` and
`SnapshotState` traits that every target uses to run, snapshot and read a
machine.

Every target type is generic over its backend. The QuickNES parts are compiled
only on Unix, because `machine::quicknes` exists only there: the `NesBackend`
and `NesMemory` implementations for `QuickNesMachine`, its LZ4 snapshot
packing, and the constructors, capture and render methods of each target that
take a ROM and a core path. The `consonance` feature adds the backend
implementation for the Consonance machine. The `test-support` feature exposes
test constructors and the scripted Super Tilt Bro machine to the tests of
`nes-workload`.

Twin Dragons, Famidash, Super Mario Bros., Mega Man 2, Metroid, Castlevania, Punch-Out!!, Zelda and Pac-Man
also have a `campaign` module with their `Workload` implementation.
`CastlevaniaGame<M>`, `TwinDragonsGame<M>`, `FamidashGame<M, GROUP>`, `SmbGame<M, P>`, `Mm2Game<M>`,
`MetroidGame<M>`, `PunchOutGame<M>`, `ZeldaGame<M>` and `PacManGame<M>` are
generic over the backend and build each target from a boxed factory, so the
native workload and the browser demo share every trait implementation: the
native one passes a QuickNES or Consonance factory, and `demos/twin-dragons`
passes one over the browser core. LZ4 snapshot packing is available on every
target for that reason. Job results are digested with
`postcard_semantic_result_sha256` from the searcher, which leaves out emulator
state, so a browser campaign and a native one produce the same decision
stream. Archive entries record a snapshot digest from `snapshot_identity_sha256`,
and an archive checkpoint must match those digests. SMB hashes the logical
snapshot identity; the other games hash the serialized snapshot.

Each game's recorded emulator policy ends with a hash field. The native
constructors take the core hash and the prepared execution hash from
`machine::quicknes::prepared_execution_sha256`, record both, and load every
machine with `QuickNesMachine::from_rom_bytes_with_identity`, which rejects a
load whose executable code differs from the prepared one. The browser demo
passes the hash of its core WASM module instead.

`arcade` holds what the arcade page draws, for both the browser campaign and a
native live campaign. `ArcadeGame` extends `Workload` with a view of each
observation, the four-number motion sample of a frame, the cleared-level count
and the emulator state of a snapshot. The `smb`, `metroid`, `mm2`, `castlevania`, `famidash`,
`twin_dragons`, `punchout`, `zelda` and `pac_man` submodules implement it for each campaign game over any
backend. `ArcadeGame` decodes RAM in static functions, so `FamidashGame` takes
the index of a level group in `famidash::levels::GROUPS` as the const
parameter `GROUP`. Each group is its own game type, with that group's side,
levels and map tops. `trail::Traced` wraps a machine and records each job's motion trail
every four frames and at every chord end, and every controller action it runs. `feed::run_noted` runs a job inside
that recorder and returns a `Note` with the trail, the view of every step and
each candidate's snapshot digest. `feed::Feed` joins notes with the
coordinator's admission decisions into the `Batch` the page reads: points,
trails, finished trails and their exits. It drops ids the archive no longer
holds once it keeps more than twice the archive's entries.
`feed::archived_state` builds a state's controller history and replays it
through a fresh target with `feed::played` when the archived input misses
frames the core ran. The digest is taken over the QuickNES
core state without the native snapshot header, so a native snapshot and a
browser capture of the same state have the same digest.

[`../nes`](../nes/README.md) re-exports these modules and keeps everything
else: campaign drivers and configuration, Super Tilt Bro's `Workload`
implementation, streams, films, evaluation, packaging, guest preparation and
binaries. The game READMEs under `../nes/src` document the RAM maps and
policies of each game.

```sh
cargo test --manifest-path workloads/nes-games/Cargo.toml --all-features
cargo check --manifest-path workloads/nes-games/Cargo.toml --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Snapshot checkpoint codecs live with these shared target types so native and
browser callers use the same checksummed `HMSNAP02` envelope. The standalone
formats are Castlevania v1, Famidash v2, Twin Dragons v2, Punch-Out!! v2, Zelda v1, Pac-Man v1, Metroid v13, Mega Man 2 v4, SMB
QuickNES v4 and SMB Consonance v3; Super Tilt Bro's native campaign selects v5.
These plain snapshots use the postcard payload codec inside the framed envelope.
Previous flat envelopes are refused. Native `nes` target modules remain
re-export shims and do not supply separate checkpoint implementations.

Immutable checkpoint images charge the full capacity of each game's emulator-state
vector and the fixed snapshot/observation value. SMB also charges its backend's
portable state and owned work-RAM copy. Shared Consonance pages and sidecar chunks
use physical allocation identities; equivalent separately allocated states remain
separate charges. Freeze clones owned buffers and retains immutable shared state.
Metroid, Mega Man 2 and SMB stream evidence from borrowed fields, preserving the
existing resume bytes without building another owned evidence graph. These shared
implementations also serve native and browser consumers; file publication remains
a native coordinator facility.

## Arcade live-feed observations

Arcade adapters expose each archived snapshot's game-frame count for exact
ready-state and lookup replay. Feed batches retain level/objective completion
points separately from sampled motion, so downsampling and terminal delivery
can preserve progress. Sampling affects presentation only. The native live
service uses the existing campaign coordinator and full admission-observation
interface; search selection and admission policy remain unchanged.
