# V-time consolidation status

Branch: `claude/consonance-virtual-time-6kvrz6`

This is the live decision and evidence ledger for
[`VTIME-CONSOLIDATION.md`](VTIME-CONSOLIDATION.md). A criterion is `PASS` only
when its positive oracle and every applicable “does not count unless” clause
have run on the milestone tree. `BLOCKED` names an external dependency without
weakening the criterion.

## Recorded decisions

1. **Milestones close strictly in N0→N6 order.** Evidence from an ancestor is
   source material, not a rerun. A later milestone does not begin until the
   current milestone's complete evidence is recorded here.
2. **The pre-existing dirty workspace is preserved.** Consolidation work uses
   a clean clone; the requested branch and all commits are pushed to `origin`
   from there.
3. **N0 freezes rows, not a hand-maintained second implementation.**
   `docs/determinism-instructions.toml` is the normative instruction-surface
   table. N6 must generate its probes from those rows and fail when row count and
   exercised count differ.
4. **LL/SC admission stops at side-effect-free EL0 retry loops.** The owned
   kernel remains LSE-only. Retry-observing loops are a documented cooperative
   residual; N6 must demonstrate the accumulating variant's divergence before
   the boundary counts as verified.
5. **KVM instruction-intercept patches remain optional tripwires; branch-clock
   patches retire.** N2 removes patches 0004 (force exit) and 0005 (MTF exact
   arrival) with the retired-branch clock. Patches 0001–0003 remain only as the
   N6 auditor for layers 1–3 and are not required for stock-KVM support.

## N0 — `DETERMINISM.md`, the document of record

### Build criteria

- **PASS:** `docs/DETERMINISM.md` contains the inductive argument, split
  assumptions, per-architecture defenses, support matrix, trust boundary, and
  consolidation decisions.
- **PASS:** `docs/determinism-instructions.toml` freezes both architectures'
  complete classes from the VM-exit plan, closure plan, and x86 X3 disposition:
  arm64 time/frequency/timer programming, identity/cache, PMU, entropy, and
  exclusive monitor; x86 CPUID, TSC, PMU, entropy, MONITOR/MWAIT, WAITPKG,
  XSAVE/MXCSR, RF, and undefined AF.
- **PASS:** factual claims cite committed evidence or are marked **untested**.
  The document intentionally retains multiple untested claims, including JIT
  trap negatives, complete generated listings, entropy audits, LL/SC boundary,
  tripwire liveness, and reproducible guest construction.
- **PASS:** the closure document is deleted; its T0–T4 work is now §7 of the
  document of record and the frozen table.

### Passes-when evidence

Documentation-specific verification on the N0 worktree:

```text
TOML parse: rows=18 arm64=9 x86_64=9 claims=ok ids=unique
Local Markdown link targets: all exist
git diff --check: exit status 0
```

Repository gates on the N0 worktree:

```text
cargo build --all-features
PASS

cargo nextest run --all-features
1314 passed, 25 skipped

cargo clippy --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings
PASS (the existing three invalid-path notices from clippy.toml remain warnings
from Clippy's configuration parser; no crate diagnostic)

cargo fmt --all -- --check
PASS

cargo deny check
advisories ok, bans ok, licenses ok, sources ok
```

The first sandboxed nextest invocation was unable to open two local telemetry
sockets (`Operation not permitted`). The same complete command rerun with local
socket permission passed all 1,314 tests; this was an execution-environment
restriction, not a tree failure.

Pinned Miri (`nightly-2026-06-16`,
`MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-permissive-provenance`; snapshot-store additionally uses
`-Zmiri-disable-isolation`) completed for every crate named by the workflow:

```text
hypercall-doorbell: PASS (1 unit + 8 loopback; public-API target ignored by design)
vm-state: PASS (10 unit + 10 determinism + 2 golden + 1 roundtrip +
  16 strict-decode + 4 version/ratio; public-API/regenerator tests ignored by design)
vmm-backend --all-features: PASS (63 unit + 3 contract + 2 dynamic +
  2 exhaustive + 20 run-loop + 1 vCPU-state; host-only targets contain zero
  Miri tests and public-API target is ignored by design)
snapshot-store --lib: PASS (14 tests)
vmm-core: PASS (433 unit + 68 integration; 105 deliberately ignored/host-only)
```

The first full `vmm-core` run exceeded the workflow's 240-minute ceiling in
`portable_snapshot::tests::hostile_lengths_and_all_truncations_are_total`.
[Issue #205](https://github.com/pH14/harmony/issues/205) records the gate
failure. The test was quadratic under interpretation because every prefix of
an 8 KiB memory image was hashed. Under Miri it now uses a structurally complete
128-byte image while still visiting every prefix of every section; native runs
retain the full 8 KiB corpus. The full native test passed, the focused Miri test
passed, and the complete `vmm-core` Miri job then passed with zero failures.

### Does-not-count-unless evidence

- **PASS:** both frozen tables cover every instruction class enumerated by
  `VM-EXIT-COUNT-VTIME.md` §2.4, the former closure document T0/T2/T4, and x86
  status decision 21 plus decisions 22–30.
- **PASS:** at least one claim is honestly untested; the N0 document records the
  entire N6 backlog as untested rather than inferring it from workload equality.

**N0 overall: PASS.** The document of record, frozen 18-row table, explicit
untested backlog, closure-document removal, and exact-tree repository/Miri
evidence satisfy both the positive and anti-vacuity clauses.

## N1 — one branch

### Integration decisions

- **Merge the complete x86 history, not a squashed patch.** The merge parent is
  `origin/claude/x86-prescriptive-vtime` at `b0c019f1`; its status ledger records
  X3 met at `57b16ce0` and the later head only removes diagnostic workflow steps.
- **The ARM dissonance tree and license policy win byte-for-byte.** The staged
  merge has no diff from N0 commit `a352b4c9` under `dissonance/` or `deny.toml`;
  the retained dissonance tree object is
  `b9148e8732b1d4b58841890210ee6cbfdc7eed8c`.
- **Preserve both historical ledgers.** Rename detection tried to combine the
  x86 `PRESCRIPTIVE-VTIME-STATUS.md` with the ARM
  `VM-EXIT-COUNT-VTIME-STATUS.md`; the resolution restores each under its own
  historical name.
- **Keep the M6 ARM delivery fabric with the shared trace name.** The arm64
  conflict retains userspace-GIC level assertion and the ruled in-kernel-GIC
  fallback, while adopting the x86 branch's architecture-neutral
  `trace_clockevent_delivery` helper.

### Integration evidence

```text
merge parents: a352b4c9 + b0c019f1
unmerged paths: none
dissonance/ and deny.toml diff against a352b4c9: empty
cargo build --all-features: PASS
```

**N1 overall: IN PROGRESS.** The source merge is resolved and builds locally.
The planted comparator negative, exact-tree repository gates, and all-three-
machine reference reruns remain.
